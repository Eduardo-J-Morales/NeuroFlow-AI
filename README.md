# NeuroFlowAI üß†‚ö°  

This web app employs an AI model, trained with TensorFlow.js, to predict whether a simulated individual is "focused" or "distracted." This prediction is based on simulated brain wave data (alpha, beta, gamma) generated every second. The app also features a glowing meter indicating the AI's confidence level in its prediction and visually represents the AI's "brain structure" using simple cards. Finally, it displays the predicted state with emojis: üß† for focused and üò¥ for distracted.
